Hey All! For the people visiting this repository. Thanks for visiting! :)
In this repository, I will include all the necessary components and also instructions on how I built my car.
For the record, I built my car from scratch and won the competition conducted by my college. So, I guess my instructions are to be taken seriously. ðŸ˜Œ 
And yea, I did have a team to help me out and a big thanks to them. Well, the more the merrier.

As of now, there's the list of components, images of the components, and images of the final car.
